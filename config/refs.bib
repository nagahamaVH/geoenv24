   abstract = "{Formal parameter estimation and model identification procedures for continuous domain spatial processes are introduced. The processes are assumed to be adequately described by a linear model with residuals that follow a second-order stationary Gaussian random field and data are assumed to consist of noisy observations of the process at arbitrary sampling locations. A general class of two-dimensional rational spectral density functions with elliptic contours is used to model the spatial covariance function. An iterative estimation procedure alleviates many of the computational difficulties of conventional maximum likelihood estimation for non-lattice data. The procedure is applied to several generated data sets and to an actual ground-water data set.}",

   abstract = {Spatial process models for analyzing geostatistical data entail computations that become prohibitive as the number of spatial locations become large. This article develops a class of highly scalable nearest-neighbor Gaussian process (NNGP) models to provide fully model-based inference for large geostatistical datasets. We establish that the NNGP is a well-defined spatial process providing legitimate finite-dimensional Gaussian densities with sparse precision matrices. We embed the NNGP as a sparsity-inducing prior within a rich hierarchical modeling framework and outline how computationally efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms can be executed without storing or decomposing large matrices. The floating point operations (flops) per iteration of this algorithm is linear in the number of spatial locations, thereby rendering substantial scalability. We illustrate the computational and inferential benefits of the NNGP over competing methods using simulation studies and also analyze forest biomass from a massive U.S. Forest Inventory dataset at a scale that precludes alternative dimension-reducing methods. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

   abstract = {In this article we use moving averages to develop new classes of models in a flexible modeling framework for stream networks. Streams and rivers are among our most important resources, yet models with autocorrelated errors for spatially continuous stream networks have been described only recently. We develop models based on stream distance rather than on Euclidean distance. Spatial autocovariance models developed for Euclidean distance may not be valid when using stream distance. We begin by describing a stream topology. We then use moving averages to build several classes of valid models for streams. Various models are derived depending on whether the moving average has a tail-up stream, a tail-down stream, or a two-tail construction. These models also can account for the volume and direction of flowing water. The data for this article come from the Ecosystem Health Monitoring Program in Southeast Queensland, Australia, an important national program aimed at monitoring water quality. We model two water chemistry variables, pH and conductivity, for sample sizes close to 100. We estimate fixed effects and make spatial predictions. One interesting aspect of stream networks is the possible dichotomy of autocorrelation between flow-connected and flow-unconnected locations. For this reason, it is important to have a flexible modeling framework, which we achieve on the example data using a variance component approach. Â© 2010 American Statistical Association.},
